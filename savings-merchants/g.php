<p>Originally named Marriott’s Great America for the Illinois theme park once known by the same name, the theme park was bought by Paramount in 1993 and was known as Paramount’s Great America until it was bought by Cedar Entertainment in 2006.<br /><br />

Many may recognize the park from its use in the movie Beverly Hills Cop III, the 1994 movie Getting Even With Dad, as well as a 2007 Excedrin commercial in which the park’s inverted steel coaster “Flight Deck” was featured. Many more may remember this particular theme park as a happy family excursion from childhood filled with fun rides like Top Gun, Vortex, Drop Zone and many others that have made us laugh, cry and scream over the years.<br /><br />

Although admission to this park isn’t as affordable as it used to be, roller coaster lovers everywhere can still save money on tickets thanks to seasonal promotions or advanced online purchasing, which can cut down the overall prices of your tickets by at least 15% off the original damage and let you head off for some theme park fun with friend and family in tow without breaking the bank.<br /><br />

So many occasions, and then there is the inevitable question of what kind of gift would hit the spot? One gift for all occasions big or small is a shirt and there is no better site on the web for that particular item than GAFY. 

In addition to shirts for any occasion, the one quality that sets this site apart from its competitors is in both the selection of designs and quotes that are apparent with each particular item. As a one-stop shop for shirts, it is also possible for prospective buyers to get all of their shopping done at one place for either one event or a number of events.

A quick glimpse of the website will show why GAFY was voted the #1 \"Most Original Funny Shirts On The Web.\" With a talking duck to greet you on the front page, buyers immediately notice the range in products for all on the front. For example, the popular \"2010 Stanley Cup Champions\" shirt may be the perfect gift for the Chicago sports fan in your family, while a more humorous \"Everyone Loves A Drunk Chick, \" shirt (with a chicken on the front drinking alcohol), screams out for young college female crowd. 

So, as one shirt says, \"Everyone starts out a winner…\" when you take the initiative to check out GAFY. However, this particular shirt which shows three sperm attempting to cross the finish line first, brings home the point that those who are light-hearted and love to have a good laugh will benefit the most. To commemorate that special event or to bring out the funny side in your or a friend, stop in and look around. It will be a guaranteed way to bring a smile to your face.

In addition to great products, several <a href=\"http://www.gafy.com\">GAFY</a> discounts on Savings.com are worth checking out.

Light a couple of candles with your \"Apple Blossom\" centerpiece or maybe set the mood with a set of Touch Table lamps, relax in your new Futon Sofa Bed and read a book from your Faux Leather Bombe Table.

That\'s not all. As health (vitamins, scales, blood pressure monitor), beauty (nail station, Bath gift set), fitness (treadmill, Easy Cycle, etc.), electronics (phones, cameras, stereo systems), toys (dolls, retro scooter, games), and gifts (tool kit, clocks, slippers, gift certificates) come into play, you\'ll realize that it is really a one stop shop all with the aim of keeping every home cozy.

Also cool is that Ginny\'s not only provides full refunds for whatever you buy (or replace the merchandise) but also provides no time limit to return all items (except for the computers that give internet service).

Unlike other cooling vests that use dangerous and harmful chemicals from petroleum products, the RPCM® (or, Renewable Phase Change Material) Vests are both safe and environmentally friendly. They maintain a cool, comfortable temperature at 59°F (15°C), and are designed never to over-cool, meaning that you can relax and rest assured that you won\'t catch a chill.

Their vests for everyday work will protect against the heat of Construction, Manufacturing, Oil and Gas, and Industrial heat exposure, while their line of Government vests are specially suited for firefighters, law enforcement officials, and those serving in the military. However, there are also numerous vests perfect for the everyday, average Joe or Jane. The Recreation line includes products for football players, hunters, and even BMX and Motocross.

The RPCM® Cool Vests can also be incredibly therapeutic in helping to provide relief to individuals suffering from conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, Breast Cancer, Ectodermal Dysphasia, and Thermogenic Anhidrosis. The Cool Vests set to work against the body\'s symptoms of overheating, sudden hot flashes, heat strokes, and heat exhaustion. By wearing a Cool Vest, you can drastically reduce, or eliminate altogether the symptoms of heat stress, which include sweating, fatigue, nausea, high temperature, disorientation, and headaches, among others.

Not to be left out, there are also special vests designed for both large and small dogs, and smaller vests for children. Interestingly enough, they have a red Santa Cool Vest, for those jolly characters who spend hours in malls and at holiday events dressed up as Saint Nick.

Whether you suffer from heat stress related symptoms on a regular basis, work in a very hot environment, or just want to be prepared, investing in a high-quality RCPM® vest is an excellent way to beat the heat. With colors and styles ranging from Classic, to Original, to Concealable and High Visibility, there is a Cool Vest suited to almost anyone\'s needs.

  array('id_index'=>3692,'id'=>287440,'name'=>'GoodLife','description'=>'GoodLife Contemporary Drinkware water bottles were born of the philosophy that a bottle shouldn\'t just hold water, it should be responsibly made, too. That\'s why GoodLife uses high-quality, food-grade 18/304 stainless steel instead of toxin-leaking aluminum. 

Every time you take a sip from a plastic or aluminum bottle, you\'re potentially gulping down traces of BPA, a hazardous chemical that has been linked to several diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, reproductive failure, and cancer. Every bottle is 100% free of BPA and toxins, 100% recyclable, always reusable, as lightweight as aluminum, and extremely durable. These bottles have become so popular that they won the 2009 User\'s Choice Award Gold Medal for best water bottle.

There are two lines of GoodLife bottles: the \'Venture\' Bottle, which holds one liter of liquid, and the slightly smaller \'Go\' Bottle, which holds 16.9 liquid ounces. Their sleek style is simple but eye-catching, and both kinds come with several color choices, including Green, Grey, Copper, Pink, Purple, and the classic Stainless Steel. 

Apart from just looking snazzy on the outside, you\'ll be glad to know that the inside is pretty nifty as well. The bottles\' interior design features dual walls, partnered with a vacuum-seal cap, meaning that whether your beverage is hot or cold, it will stay that way for up to 24 hours. This means that now your water bottle can also conveniently double-up as a thermos, for your morning coffee or tea before bedtime. Each bottle is also safe to use in both your refrigerator and dishwasher.

You don\'t have to be an athlete or an environmentalist to appreciate all that a GoodLife bottle has to offer. Using a durable, reusable bottle will not only cut back drastically on the unhealthy toll that plastic bottles take on the environment. It also will cut back on the amount of money that you spend each month on drinking water. You can rest assured that you\'re not unknowingly putting anything harmful into your body by drinking from a toxin-leaching container, and of course, you\'ll be sipping in style from one of the most attractive bottles on the market.

That may be so, but there\'s something to be said about having the best tools available at your disposal, whether or not you\'re lazy. It\'s probably a lot easier to get that term paper worth half your final grade done with all the tools in the machine shop, than using only the rusty monkey wrench. With that weird comparison in mind, you should check out Gradware Academic Software.

They have one of the widest range of software, hardware and accessories that you need to be properly equipped for school, from leading manufacturers such as Adobe, Corel, Wacom and Microsoft. All of these, at mind-blowing low, discounted prices (to make your inner tightwad very happy). Check this out: Adobe Professional 9 Student and Teacher Edition. Formerly, $449. Now, $119.95. That\'s a savings of $329.05, or in more scholarly terms, you just got a 73% discount. Our math may be off, but their prices sure aren\'t.

Do you feel the miser inside of you smiling yet? If not, check this out. Microsoft Office Professional was $499.99, but for you, it\'s been slashed to $99.99. You just saved 80% off the list price! You might want to start thinking up uses for all the money you\'ll save buying Gradware Academic Software deals, because you\'re going to have a lot of it soon enough.

The best way to beat the elements is with a controlled environment in a greenhouse. This will allow you to grow tropical plants even when it’s snowing outside.

Now, if you are a more serious gardener and need something large and you\'ve got the money to spend. The RIGA XL 14\' x 20\' Complete Greenhouse Kit is a beautifully crafted system. This greenhouse runs at a solid price of $10,995, but it is an entirely complete greenhouse kit. Although it requires a bit of assembly once you have it together it has everything you need.

HD Greetings, which creates high definition, high fun factor video products, has taken this idea to whole new level by making it possible to now send personalized video in a way that is not possible anywhere else on the Internet. With a self-made platform called Light Factory Media, the company has been able to develop technology which enables a wide-range of web-based media services. 

HD Greetings works with a group of talented animators to make these products come to life, including some who have worked on big-budget animated films such as Warner Brother\'s 2004 hit, Polar Express.

So, just what kinds of video are we talking about here? One of the most popular ways to acknowledge an event on the website is by sending the recipient a favorite music video, with an option to add a caption and photos to the video. Top music sellers, Miley Cyrus and Nick Jonas, are just a few of today\'s top hitmakers who are featured with songs that help share anyone\'s special moment. 

Comedic e-cards are aplenty and have a number of unique variations of greetings that are sure to bring a smile to anyone\'s face. One such example is the birthday e-card \"toasting\" the recipient - however instead of champagne, five pieces of toast come marching onto the screen singing happy birthday greetings! Categories are separated into special days such as Valentine\'s Day or Graduation, so it is easy for the customer to navigate through the large amount of inventory to find just the right item.

HD Greetings promotions and HD Greetings coupons are constant, unlike other companies, because the company always lists a substantial number of its e-cards for free. However, for just $15.95, customers can create and send unlimited cards for a whole year.

If you have children, you know how awful it is to sit with them while they are having trouble breathing. That\'s why Health Purifiers created the Baby\'s Breath air purifier to remove the allergens and irritants from your child\'s environment. It eliminates smoke, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals by using a patented system of medical-grade HEPA filtration and a military-grade carbon cloth filter. This equipment can clean up to 700 square feet in less than an hour and captures over 99% of all airborne particles.

You should also make sure to take care of yourself, and the Healthmate air purifier is exactly the product to do it. It has the same cleaning features as the Baby\'s Breath but is able to clean an amazing 1500 square feet in about fifteen minutes. Because it sits on rolling casters, it is easy to move from room to room until you have your whole house fresh and clean.

If someone in your house is particularly sensitive to common chemicals like formaldehyde or household cleaners, the HealthMate Jr. Plus is the machine for them. While it provides the same benefits as the Healthmate, in addition it contains potassium iodide within its machinery, which makes it particularly effective at removing chemicals from the air. You can buy filters for every air purifier that Health Purifiers sells, including models like the Bedroom Machine, the Allergy Machine, and the Pet Machine.

  array('id_index'=>4091,'id'=>271503,'name'=>'Home For Exchange','description'=>'Imagine that you and your family have saved up for full year to take a vacation across the country. As time nears to take the trip, you notice hotel prices rising, so much so, that the ability to take the trip may be in peril. 

If you have been in this situation like so many, then you need to run over to Home For Exchange. The vision by owner Ans Lammers was to create a marketplace for non-commercial home exchange, which enables families to literally \"switch\" homes. One family will stay in the other family\'s home in lieu of spending extra costs on shelter accommodations for a short period of time.
One of the main concerns prospective members have with an idea like this is safety and legality. 

For that reason, all individuals who wish to partake in a home exchange are required to sign a standard exchange contract detailing time and arrival of each family, all the way down to, the exchange of keys. For those wanting to take it a step further, a car exchange is also possible for families wishing to save on gas en route to their destination. In the event of a cancellation of a trip, accommodation insurance is available to cover everyday happenings such as illness or an immediate death in the family.

Lammers states on her website that families can save well over $1000.00 in gas and accommodation per exchange, which makes the 59.00 annual fee well worth it. Further Home For Exchange coupons and Home For Exchange discounts and promotions can be found on Savings.com at the moment as well, including a great incentive to join right now. The company is giving members six months of free membership after paying their first year of annual dues. 

<a href=\"http://www.homeforexchange.com\">Home For Exchange</a> has 95% success rate of home exchanges that went well for families in their first year with the company. If for some reason, an individual or family does not find a suitable exchange partner in the first year, membership will be extended another year at the member\'s request, without charge.','displayUrl'=>'http://www.homeforexchange.com/','imageUrl'=>'http://cdn.savings.com/logo/1629949.png','allowPartnerDeals'=>'true','categoryIds'=>20228),

Rather than buying a bottle of expensive perfume at the mall at full price, you can order it from House of Beauty for a fraction of the cost- and the item is 100% genuine, never an imitation brand or copy-cat.

One of the best highlights of House Of Beauty is that they feature an enormous selection of wigs, weaves, and extensions. You can take your pick from numerous options under any of these hair categories: Clip-In or Fusion Hair Extensions, Drawstring Ponytails, Human Hair Weaves, and Synthetic, Lace, Human, Remy, Virgin, and Wholesale wigs. 

Going to a costume party and need something cheap and simple? They\'ve got your wig. Need something realistic-looking, but on a budget? They\'ve got your wig. Looking for the most beautiful, high-grade, durable wig on the market? Once again, they\'ve got what you need, and at a huge savings to you. There are wigs to fit every hair color and ethnicity, in a variety of different lengths, textures, and styles, so you can find a perfect match for what you have in mind.

If you\'ve already got a Wii, we think you\'ll like your options.

This store also carries all the best Wii games available, from the latest to the more obscure. These include the popular series Rock Band and Guitar Hero, and all of their related accessories, like instruments and guitar stands.

Of course, sometimes you need the more boring items, like chargers and memory cards, and they have a full line of these too. You can easily replace the component cables your little brother cut into pieces, or the memory card that\'s just been impossible to find using their easy and uncluttered website.

The product lines they sell are much higher quality than what you would find at your typical big box retailer.

If you\'re looking for kitchen products, they sell high quality brands like Kalorik, Omcan, and Uniworld that you would typically find in restaurants rather than at home, but their regular low prices bring you professional quality products at consumer brand prices. In addition, they have a ton of appliances that are hard to find, like dehydrators, processors, grinders, slicers, steamers, warmers, sausage stuffers, popcorn machines, pizza ovens, everything you could possibly need in the kitchen.

In home furnishings, they sell name brands like Pacific Coast, Natural Living, and Stowe, so you know that what you\'re buying is high quality, well-designed, and beautiful.

For shoppers on a budget, or for those who just love a good deal, their periodic mega-sales and clearances of up to 60% off mean that you can find extremely high quality products at extremely affordable prices.

And HousewaresOnly.com discounts also include an unusually good return policy for an online retailer. If you find that you\'re not satisfied with the purchase for any reason, the return is free shipping, so it won\'t cost you anything.
